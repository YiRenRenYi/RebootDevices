# Reboot Devices

This is the source code for Reboot Devices, a simple code to reboot Meraki devices in bluk using Meraki API calls.

## Solution Components
* Meraki Dashboard API

## Installation:
####
```console
git clone https://github.com/YiRenRenYi/RebootDevices.git
```
#### Set up a Python venv
First make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. We will then be using venv to create
an isolated environment with only the necessary packages.

##### Install virtualenv via pip
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

##### Create a new venv
```
Change to your project folder
$ cd code

Create the venv
$ virtualenv venv

Activate your venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Meraki details:
You can deploy this prototype in a lab environment or on your own Meraki dashboard online
[here](https://account.meraki.com/secure/login/dashboard_login).

To generate an API KEY, refer to the documentation [here](https://documentation.meraki.com/zGeneral_Administration/Other_Topics/The_Cisco_Meraki_Dashboard_API#Enable_API_access).
You will use this for using this application.

Fill in the details of your Meraki API in the .env file


## How to Use

Use the Meraki dashboard to download device serial number, and put in the MX.csv file. Please remove any quotation marks

Run the code. It will read the serial number from the MX.csv file and reboot the device one-by-one.

The devices failed to be rebooted will be write into the file RebootFailedDevices.csv with their serial numbers. Please take a copy of the serial numbers before you re-run the code, as the file will be re-writed.

Copy and paste the serial numbers from the RebootFailedDevices.csv into MX.csv, and run the code again to reboot these devices until all devices get rebooted successfully.
